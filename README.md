```
- This web app allows users to type in lyric fragments (song titles, artists, etc.) and have a list of songs appear that contain those lyrics. When the user selects one of the results, a modal appears that includes a GIPHY search to pull related GIFs tied to the song title selected
- Often times, people are stuck wondering what song these lyrics they remember or hear are from. This app intends to resolve this problem

## User Story 

```
As a music lover with an average memory.
I want to be able to search lyrics and see results appear with songs that have those lyrics.
So that I can see the song Iâ€™m looking for and plus a related GIF for a nice laugh.
